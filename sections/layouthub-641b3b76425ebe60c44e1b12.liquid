We strive to give our customers a positive experience each time they buy from us, so we encourage them to ask for swatches when in doubt. This will help them to pick the most appropriate fabric and color because, due to the variations in computer screens, it is possible that the fabric will look slightly different in color on our website. To order swatches, get in touch with our customer support team.

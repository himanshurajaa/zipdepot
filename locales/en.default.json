While Dry Fast Foam is ideal for damp environments because its open cell structure makes it non-water absorbent, and its anti-microbial properties make it an excellent choice for outdoor cushions.

The first criteria you need to decide is whether the requirement is for indoor usage or outdoor usage. For outdoor usage you should go with our performance fabrics from Sunbrella and Agora that are meant for the outdoors and everything raw that mother nature has to offer. For indoor usage we recommend our Indoor Collection. Based on the frequency of usage you should consider the martindale rating of a fabric. Once you have technicalities figured out and know what type would be perfect for your use case, you can move on to the design\/look-feel aspect. Explore a wide variety of designs, fabric type, finish, colors and patterns that you feel will be perfect for your ideal setting.<!--lh-live-editor-->","lh_ezhhnw_name":"Can I get fabric swatches to match with my home decor?","lh_ezhhnw_content_html":"We'd be happy to send you fabric swatches.
